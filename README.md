# Ultimate Triangle Functions
_Now with RUST_

The journey of me learning rust by implementing everything I can think of with triangles.

## What can this mighty program do?

1. Create triangles with points.
2. Find the distance between two points to get length of a side.
3. Calculate the perimeter of a triangle.
4. Calculate the area of a triangle (Normal way and with Heron's Formula).
5. Check whether a point is inside a triangle.
6. Check whether a triangle is inside another triangle.
7. Check whether a triangle can contain another triangle.

## How to run

Clone the repo to your machine. Make sure [Rust](rust-lang.org) is installed.

```sh
cargo run
```
